# POKERSTARTERS
I am designing a website called PokerStarters that is aimed at providing information and guidance 
to players of the classic card game poker. My target audience primarily includes beginners who are 
interested in learning the basics of poker, as well as casual players looking to improve their skills 
and knowledge.
I came up with the idea for PokerStarters after experiencing the frustration of having to teach new 
players the rules of poker without a good resource and also realising that poker can be quite 
intimidating for newcomers, with its complex strategies, different variations, and specific 
terminology. I therefore wanted to create a friendly, informative platform where people could easily 
access the information they need to learn, play, and enjoy poker without feeling overwhelmed or 
discouraged.
To achieve this my site will contain the following elements as web-pages: rules and basics, rules of 
various poker variants (like Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud), strategies and tips, and 
a rules quiz. The site will also contain contact information and a contact form.

## Design Decisions 
Here Iâ€™ll go through the Nelson Norman Usability Heuristics, a well known UI evaluation 
framework, and evaluate my design with the goal of it being minimal and intuitive. 
1. **Visibility of System Status:**
The navigation bar at the top of the every page serves as a clear indicator of the position of the user 
on the site. The pages have also be named with the intention of providing clear and descriptive titles
of the contents of each page. Furthermore, the contact form fields are highlighted when being edited
providing the user with a clearer indication of the sites response to their action. 
2. **Match between System and Real World:**
The language used on the site has been chosen to be as clear and concise as possible whilst also 
conveying adequate information. The buttons and fields where used have been chosen such that 
they appear inter actable and akin to their physical equivalents. They layout of many of the pages 
has been inspired by the instruction cards you may find in your favourite well explained board 
game. 
3. **User Control and Freedom:**
The logo on the top right of the page allows the user to return to the landing page and the navigation
provides direct access to pages, giving the user the freedom to browse the site. The quiz also 
contains a pop up asking the user to confirm they are ready to submit before they actually do. 
4. **Consistency and Standards:**
The navigation menu has been kept in the same location on all pages and follows common 
convention in its design. A grid system has been used on most pages a provides readability and 
consistent spacing and alignment throughout the site. 
5. **Error Prevention:**
The site validates emails and phone numbers added into the contacts page to ensure they are 
acceptable. The fields are also highlighted if a value is considered invalid. After pressing the submit
button on the quiz the user will receive a pop up if a question has been left un answered allowing 
them the opportunity to add a answer to it. 
6. **Recognition Rather than Recall:**
The labels on sections throughout the site are clear and concise. This will hopefully allow the user 
to identify the section they are looking for faster. The use of emojis in certain text bodies invites the 
user to engage with the text more. 
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**:
The user can skip sections they already know using the navigation bar and taking advantage of clear
section titles. Experienced users can also quickly navigate to the advanced strategies section by 
minimising irrelevant content on the page. 
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**:
The layout of pages is broken up with images and text is containerised with relevant titles. The 
overall amount of text has been minimised and descriptions are as concise as possible. 
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** 
When a user has provided incorrect contact information the field that is invalid will be highlighted 
in red to identify to the user the error. They will then be able to promptly recover from the error and 
submit the form. Furthermore, after completing the quiz the user will receive their results and a 
percentage in a pop up. 
10. **Help and Documentation:**
The glossary section allows the user to lookup poker specific jargon. The Youtube link will also be 
directed to an informative video to further explain the game.
