After the first round of betting three community cards are drawn and displayed in the centre of the table, another round of better will then follow.  After this the final community card is drawn and the final round of betting is undertaken. At any time a player may fold and they will no longer be able to participate in the hand. In any round of betting each player must match the previous bet or check (if they have already matched). The remaining players after the final round of betting will display their hands the highest hand wins the pot. </div>

                <li class="term" data-content="A small bet all players are required to make before a hand is dealt. An ante is similar to a blind, but everyone has to contribute it before a hand commences. Antes give the pot a value right off the bat.">ANTE</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A bet that places all of a player's chips into the pot.">ALL-IN</li>
                <li class="term" data-content='Hitting your needed cards on the turn and the river to make your hand. For example, if theres one heart on the board and you have two in your hand and two more hearts show up on the turn and river, youve hit a: backdoor flush.'>BACKDOOR</li>

                <li class="term" data-content='A retelling or recollection of a bad beat. These are often boring tales you already know the end of.

                <li class="term" data-content="The amount of chips the second player to the left of the dealer has to bet. The amount depends on the stakes. Like an ante, it is a posted amount that makes the pot worth playing for before the action begins. It is equivalent to one complete first round bet.

                <li class="term" data-content="The generic term for either the big blind or the small blind. If you are one of the blinds, you are sitting either immediately to the left of the dealer button (small blind position) or one position farther left (big blind).">BLIND</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="The discarding of the top card before each betting round. In the case that there is a distinguishing mark on the top card, the burn card keeps the next card to be dealt concealed before it comes out.
