        <div class="grid-content">Poker table etiquette ensures a respectful and enjoyable atmosphere. Key aspects include: being punctual; paying attention to the game and acting in turn; avoiding excessive chatter, especially about ongoing hands; not revealing cards or providing unsolicited advice; keeping chips and cards visible; being courteous to dealers and opponents; handling winning and losing gracefully; maintaining personal hygiene; refraining from using electronic devices during the game; and avoiding slow rolling, string betting, or other improper actions.</div>

        <div class="grid-header">Flop, Turn, River</div>
        <div class="grid-content">In Texas Hold'em, the flop, turn, and river are integral parts of the game that shape its outcome. The flop, consisting of the first three community cards, is dealt face-up after the initial round of betting. It unveils crucial information, offering players insights into potential hand strengths and possibilities. After the flop, the turn card is revealed, adding a fourth community card to the table. This card often alters the dynamics of the game, prompting players to reassess their strategies based on the expanded range of hand combinations. Finally, the river card, the fifth and final community card, is revealed. It represents players' last chance to improve their hands. The river determines the complete set of community cards available to all players. Following the river, a final round of betting takes place, leading to a showdown if multiple players remain. The player with the strongest five-card hand, comprising their hole cards and the community cards, emerges as the victor. The flop, turn, and river thus introduce crucial decision points, suspense, and strategic considerations in the thrilling game of Texas Hold'em.</div>

                <li class="term" data-content="To run out of chips while betting or calling. In table stakes games, a player may not go into their pocket for more money during a hand.

He made quads against the big full house, but he was all-in on the second bet.">All-in</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A small portion of a bet contributed by each player to seed the pot at the beginning of a poker hand. Most Hold'em games do not have an ante; they use blinds to get initial money into the pot.">Ante</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="To discard the top card from the deck, face down. This is done between each betting round before putting out the next community card(s). It is security against any player recognizing or glimpsing the next card to be used on the board.">Burn</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="To call more than one bet in a single action. For instance, suppose the first player to act after the big blind raises.

                <li class="term" data-content="To make your hand less valuable because of board cards that duplicate it. Example: you have 87 and the flop comes 9-T-J, so you have a straight.

                <li class="term" data-content="To beat a hand - typically a big hand. You hear this most often applied to pocket aces: Third time tonight I've had pocket aces cracked.">Crack</li>

When a professional dealer (casino or cardroom) or automated dealer (online) is present - it is necessary to identify the player who would be dealing the cards because the blinds and the betting action are to the left of the dealer. This is done by utilizing a marker called a dealer button which travels around the table in a clockwise manner, moving to the next player after each hand is completed.">Dealer</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="Shortened form of underdog.">Dog</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A hand that will almost always lose to a better hand that people usually play. For instance, K3 is dominated by KQ. With the exception of strange flops (e.g., 3-3-X, K-3-X), it will usually lose to KQ.">Dominated Hand</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="To play a hand that is not yet good, but could become so if the right cards come. Example: I'm not there yet - I'm drawing. Also used as a noun. Example: I have to call because I have a good draw.">Draw</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="Trying to make a hand that, even if made, will not win the pot. If you're drawing to make a flush, and your opponent already has a full house, you are drawing dead. Of course, this is a bad condition to be in.">Draw Dead</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="Your rightful share of a pot. If the pot contains $80, and you have a 50% chance of winning it, you have $40 equity in the pot. This term is somewhat fanciful since you will either win $80 or $0, but it gives you an idea of how much you can expect to win.">Equity</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="(1) The amount you expect to gain on average if you make a certain play. For instance, suppose you put $10 into a $50 pot to draw at a hand that you will make 25% of the time, and it will win every time you make it. Three out of four times, you do not make your draw, and lose $10 each time for a total of $30. The fourth time, you will make your draw, winning $50. Your total gain over those four average hands is $50-$30 = $20, an average of $5 per hand. Thus, calling the $10 has a positive expectation of $5. (2) The amount you expect to make at the poker table in a specific time period. Suppose in 100 hours of play, you win $527. Then your expectation is $5.27/hr. Of course, you won't make that exact amount each hour (and some hours you will lose), but it's one measure of your anticipated earnings.">Expectation</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A blind put in by a player just entering the game, returning to the game, or otherwise changing his position at the table. See also blind and post.">Extra Blind</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="As in play fast. To play a hand aggressively, betting and raising as much as possible. Example: When you flop a set but there's a flush draw possible, you have to play it fast.">Fast</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A poker hand which is the statistical favorite to win.">Favourite</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="The first three community cards, put out face-up, altogether.">Flop</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="A hand that may not be played for one reason or another. A player with a foul hand may not make any claim on any portion of the pot. Example: He ended up with three cards after the flop, so the dealer declared his hand foul.">Foul</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A turn or river card on which you don't have to call a bet because of play earlier in the hand (or because of your reputation with your opponents). For instance, if you are on the button and raise when you flop a flush draw, your opponents may check to you on the turn. If you make your flush on the turn, you can bet. If you don't get it on the turn, you can check as well, seeing the river card for free.">Free Card</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="One player has a shot at winning an entire pot when he is currently tied with another player. For instance, suppose you have A-Q of clubs and your opponent has A-Q of hearts. The flop is Q-5-T including two clubs. You are tied with your opponent right now, but are free rolling, because you can win the whole pot and your opponent can't. If no club comes, you split the pot with him; if it does come, you win the whole thing.">Free Roll</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A straight filled inside. If you have 9-8, the flop comes 7-5-2, and the turn is the 6, you've made your gutshot straight.">Gutshot Straight</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A pot that is being contested by only two players. Example: It was heads up by the turn.">Heads Up</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="As in the flop hit me, meaning the flop contains cards that help your hand. If you have AK, and the flop comes K-7-2, it hit you.">Hit</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="Pot odds that do not exist at the moment, but may be included in your calculations because of bets you expect to win if you hit your hand. For instance, you might call with a flush draw on the turn even though the pot isn't offering you quite 4:1 odds (your chance of making the flush) because you're sure you can win a bet from your opponent on the river if you make your flush.">Implied Odds</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="Seeking one specific card value to make a straight. For instance, a player holding 9-5 with a board of 2-7-6 can make a straight with any eight. This is also known as a gutshot straight draw.">Inside Straight Draw</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A special bonus paid to the loser of a hand if he gets a very good hand beaten. In Hold'em, the loser must typically get aces full or better beaten. In some of the large southern California card clubs, jackpots have gotten over $50,000. The jackpot is funded with money removed from the game as part of the rake.">Jackpot</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="An unpaired card used to determine the better of two near-equivalent hands. For instance, suppose you have AK and your opponent has AQ. If the flop has an ace in it, you both have a pair of aces, but you have a king kicker. Kickers can be vitally important in Hold'em.">Kicker</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A forced bet put in by one or more players before any cards are dealt. The live means those players still have the option of raising when the action gets back around to them.">Live Blind</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A player who does a lot of hyper-aggressive raising, betting, and bluffing. A true maniac is not a good player, but is simply doing a lot of gambling. However, a player who occasionally acts like a maniac and confuses his opponents is quite dangerous.">Maniac</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="The pile of folded and burned cards in front of the dealer. Example: His hand hit the muck so the dealer ruled it folded even though the guy wanted to get his cards back. Also used as a verb. Example: He didn't have any outs so he mucked his hand.">Muck</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="A version of poker in which a player may bet any amount of chips (up to the number in front of them) whenever it is their turn to act. It is a very different game from limit poker.">No Limit</li>
                <li class="term" data-content="The best possible hand given the board. If the board is K-J-T-4-2 with three hearts, then A-X of hearts is the nuts (with X representing a card of any value). You will occasionally hear the term applied to the best possible hand of a certain category, even though it isn't the overall nuts.

                <li class="term" data-content="To show down a hand in Hold'em when your cards don't make a hand any better than is shown on the board. For instance, if you have 22, and the board is 4-4-9-9-A (no flush possible), then you must play the board: the best possible hand you can make doesn't use any of your cards.

                <li class="term" data-content="A version of poker in which a player may bet up to the amount of money in the pot whenever it is his turn to act. Like No Limit, this is a very different game from limit poker.">Pot Limit</li>

Pot odds also apply to draws. For instance, suppose you have a draw to the nut flush with one card left to come. In this case, you are about a 4:1 underdog to make your flush.

                <li class="term" data-content="A powerful concept first discussed by David Sklansky. It is a bet or raise that you hope will not be called, but you have some outs if it is. A semi-bluff may be correct when betting for value is not correct, a pure bluff is not correct, but the combination of the two may be a positive expectation play. Example: you have K-Q, and the flop is T-5 -J. If you bet now, it's a semi-bluff. You probably don't have the best hand, and you'd like to see your opponents fold immediately. Nevertheless, if you do get callers, you could still improve to the best hand.">Semi-Bluff</li>

                <li class="term" data-content="A bet (more typically a raise) in which a player doesn't get all the chips required for the raise into the pot in one motion.
